        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Every product (and human!) has a happy path, ways it can malfunction, and methods for getting the most value from it. I’m like a product in those ways. And like a product, evaluate me by my happy path and edge cases.</p>
        <p>My goal for this document is to share my operating system — how I think and work — so that you get a sense of what it would be like to partner with me as your manager & teammate.</p>
